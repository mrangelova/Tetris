## Getting started

* GUI

        <cd gui>
        <ruby main.rb>

* CLI

        <cd cli>
        <ruby main.rb>


## Running tests

        <bundle exec rspec spec>

I would expect anything that runs Gosu/Ruby should run this, but only tested on Windows.

Only running ot Windows. Tested with CMD.

## Requirements
